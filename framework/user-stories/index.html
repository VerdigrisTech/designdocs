<blockquote>
<p>Contributor(s): Vik Babu, Chaitanya Sharma &amp; Thomas Chung</p>
</blockquote>
<p>User Stories help us bucket &amp; prioritize tasks in our product. The attached PDF is meant to facilitate learning in user interviews. Different personas will prioritize stories differently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download &amp; print user story cards <a href="/assets/user-stories.pdf">PDF</a></li>
<li>Seperate cards into Impact, Status &amp; Commission stacks</li>
<li>Ask a participant to identify which cards they have an affinity for &amp; why</li>
<li>Map findings to a user story to persona matrix</li>
<li>Extend stories into user tasks or features</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi, I'm a Product Designer for Verdigris &amp; I'm researching energy awareness in facilities. I'm asking personas about how they manage or interact with energy in their facilities. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What are your energy savings or efficiency goals if any?</li>
<li>What are some of the tasks and tools you use to help you achieve these goals?</li>
<li>Are you looking to buy a sub-metering solution?</li>
<li>What criteria do you have for selecting a sub-metering solution?</li>
<li>What is the size of your facility in sq ft and how many panels do you have on site?</li>
