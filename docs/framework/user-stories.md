#User Stories & Task Prioritization

> Contributor(s): Vik Babu, Chaitanya Sharma & Thomas Chung

User Stories help us bucket & prioritize tasks in our product. The attached PDF is meant to facilitate learning in user interviews. Different personas will prioritize stories differently.

- Download & print user story cards [PDF](/assets/user-stories.pdf)
- Seperate cards into Impact, Status & Commission stacks
- Ask a participant to identify which cards they have an affinity for & why
- Map findings to a user story to persona matrix
- Extend stories into user tasks or features

##User Interview Script

> Hi, I'm a Product Designer for Verdigris & I'm researching energy awareness in facilities. I'm asking personas about how they manage or interact with energy in their facilities. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?

1. What are your energy savings or efficiency goals if any?
2. What are some of the tasks and tools you use to help you achieve these goals?
3. Are you looking to buy a sub-metering solution?
4. What criteria do you have for selecting a sub-metering solution?
5. What is the size of your facility in sq ft and how many panels do you have on site?

##User Stories, Impact
###View building energy usage over time
“We were able to better track the impact of energy savings initiatives that our company implemented.”
###View comparative energy usage
“Once we determined our benchmarking metrics, kWh per person, we were able to better plan for expansion.”
###Engage in energy tips & suggestions
“The customized energy savings recommendations that Verdigris provided helped us save 12% on our energy bill.”
###View panel & circuit usage over time
“By isolating our energy usage to specific places, we were able to analyze target areas that were high saving potential.”
###View device energy usage over time
“By tracking device level energy, we knew which inactive electronics were plugged in but were not being used.”
###View category energy usage
“I was able to find out my energy usage distribution across energy cost centers and compare them to ideal standards.”

##User Stories, Status
###View building power vitals in realtime
“We were able to better manage our facilities energy demands during peak power periods.”
###View panel & circuit vitals in realtime
“When our breaker approached it’s maximum rated current capacity, we were able to spot the upcoming circuit trip.”
###Alerted to panel circuit anomalies
“With building.ai alert feature, we were able to quickly respond to panel downtime caused by tripped circuit breakers.”
###View device power vitals in realtime
“By seeing device level power draw, we knew exactly which devices to power off in response to peak demand alerts.”

##User Stories, Commission
###Nametag a device, panel & circuit
“By defining my own panel & circuit names, I knew exactly where in the facility an event was occurring.”
###Specify building details
“Providing our facility details, sq ft, people, work areas, we were able to identify high energy intensity areas.”
