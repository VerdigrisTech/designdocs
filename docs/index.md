# The Verdigris Product Design Wiki

A document repository for product design research, canvases, processes & frameworks. The product design team is building a process to map, build and verify the experience framework for all Verdigris assets.

We will often reference the documents contained herein. We encourage multi disciplinary contributions towards this effort towards inter department communication & transparency.

##Canvas
Mapping out product goals & solutions, for the products currently in development

##Frameworks
Processes & language for designing experiences & brands of value

##Research
A collection of relevant research on everything from UX to the environment
